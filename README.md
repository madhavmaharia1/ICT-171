Project Description
As part of my cloud server assignment, I developed a travel-focused blog website using WordPress, deployed on an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance.Additionally, I registered a domain name, connected it to the server through DNS, and secured the entire site using SSL/TLS encryption via Certbot.

Video Explainer
A short video explainer demonstrates the complete process, including cloud setup, domain linking, and site walkthrough: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8Awugs7gpk6PXjozEqtJwhxHEDcPf_9/view?usp=drive_link

SSL Certificate
SSL was enabled using Certbot.
The certificate was successfully issued for:
https://travel-madhav.online
This ensures all traffic is encrypted and secure using HTTPS.

Week 2: Installed Certbot and configured SSL for HTTPS.
Week 3: Customized WordPress by replacing the default theme with a custom design and adding new content pages.
